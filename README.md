# Puppet module for managing Foreman

Installs and configures [Foreman](https://theforeman.org), part of the [Foreman
installer](https://github.com/theforeman/foreman-installer) or to be used as a
Puppet module.

Many Foreman plugins can be installed by adding additional `foreman::plugin::*`
classes, extra compute resource support via `foreman::compute::*` classes and
the Hammer CLI can be installed by adding `foreman::cli`.

By default, it configures Foreman to run under Apache and Passenger plus
with a PostgreSQL database. A standalone service can be configured instead by
setting `passenger` to false, though this isn't recommended in production.

The web interface is configured to use Puppet's SSL certificates by default, so
ensure they're present first, reconfigure `server_ssl_*` or disable the `ssl`
parameter. When used with the 'puppet' module, it will generate a new CA and
the required certificate.

Lots of parameters are supplied to tune the default installation, which may be
found in the class documentation at the top of each manifest.

Other modules may be used in combination with this one: [puppet](https://github.com/theforeman/puppet-puppet)
for managing a Puppet master and agent, and [foreman_proxy](https://github.com/theforeman/puppet-foreman_proxy)
to configure Foreman's Smart Proxy and related services.

## Database support

This module supports configuration of either SQLite, PostgreSQL or MySQL as the
database for Foreman. The database type can be changed using the `db_type`
parameter, or management disabled with `db_manage`.

The default database is PostgreSQL, which will be fully installed and managed
on the host this module is applied to. Databases will be created with using the
`en_US.utf8` locale, which means a respective OS locale must be available on
the database host. If using MySQL, the puppetlabs-mysql module must be added to
the modulepath, otherwise it's not required.

## Support policy

At any time, the module supports two releases, however the previous version
may require parameters to be changed from their default values. These should
be noted below.

Thus 'master' will support the upcoming major version and the current stable.
The latest release (git tag, Puppet Forge) should support current and the
previous stable release.

### Foreman version compatibility notes

This module targets Foreman 2.0+.

## Running without passenger

To use this module without passenger, the `passenger` parameter must be set to
`false`. This will install the `foreman-service` package and ensure the service
is running.

This introduces a soft dependency on `camptocamp-systemd`.

## Types and providers

`foreman_config_entry` can be used to manage settings in Foreman's database, as
seen in _Administer > Settings_. Provides:

* `cli` provider uses `foreman-rake` to change settings (default)

`foreman_hostgroup` can create and manage host group in Foreman's database.
Providers:

* `rest_v2` provider uses API v2 with apipie-bindings and OAuth (default)

`foreman_smartproxy` can create and manage registered smart proxies in
Foreman's database. Providers:

* `rest_v3` provider uses API v2 with Ruby HTTP library, OAuth and JSON (default)
* `rest_v2` provider uses API v2 with apipie-bindings and OAuth

## Foreman ENC via hiera

There is a function `foreman::enc` to retrieve the ENC data. This returns the
data as a hash and can be used in Hiera. This requires the URL to use the
Puppet CA infrastructure:

```yaml
---
version: 5
hierarchy:
  - name: "Foreman ENC"
    data_hash: foreman::enc
    options:
      url: https://foreman.example.com
```

It is also possible to use HTTP basic auth by adding a username/password to the
URL in the form of `https://username:password@foreman.example.com`.

Then within your manifests you can use `lookup`. For example, in
`manifests/site.pp`:

```puppet
node default {
  lookup('classes', {merge => unique}).include
}
```
